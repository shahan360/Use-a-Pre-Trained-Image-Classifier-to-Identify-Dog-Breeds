Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: No. While, alexnet and resnet classified this image correctly as "lhasa, lhasa apso" breed which is corrct breed classification. vgg classified this image as that of "tibetan terrier, chrysanthemum dog" breed.


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Yes, While, alexnet and resnet classified images Dog_01.jpg and Dog_02.jpg correctly as "lhasa, lhasa apso" breed. vgg classified images Dog_01.jpg and Dog_02.jpg as that of "tibetan terrier, chrysanthemum dog" breed. 


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: Yes, the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs. 


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: I feel that arch "alexnet" model architecture did best among the three model architecture at classifying the four uploaded images. I selected this as the best because first of all its pct_match(percentage match) is about 50% which is greater then "resnet" for which pct_match(percentage match) is only about 50%. Also, this "alexnet" model architecture is fast in classifying images when compared to "vgg" and "resnet" model architectures.
